# Sam Vredenburgh 3007 Final Project

This is the presentation piece for the 3007 final. It includes this repo, the [deployed site](https://uelski.github.io/3007-final/), and the final report PDF that is accessible via the deployed site as well as submitted through the formal submission process in 2DU.

I decided to use my web development skills to spin up this simple single page app using the Typescript/React Vite template. It also gave me a chance to explore Vite. 

Thank you!
